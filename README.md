## About

Council Data Project is an open-source project dedicated to providing journalists,
activists, researchers, and all members of each community we serve with the tools they
need to stay informed and hold their Council Members accountable.

By combining and simplifying sources of information on Council meetings and actions,
CDP ensures that everyone is empowered to participate in local government.

Each municipality that CDP supports (_a CDP instance_) has open source maintainers
which write code to gather municipality meeting information and compile them into a
single resource to then be processed, stored, and made accessible by our general CDP
tooling.
